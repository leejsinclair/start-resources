A startup that grows at 5% a week will in 4 years be making $25 million a month. [1]\r\n\r\n* Our calculations put 5% growth at 4 years at 5% should result in $8,214,906 per week.\r\n\r\n[1] What if a company grew at 1.7x a year for a really long time? Could it not grow just as big as any successful startup? In principle yes, of course. If our hypothetical company making $1000 a month grew at 1% a week for 19 years, it would grow as big as a company growing at 5% a week for 4 years. But while such trajectories may be common in, say, real estate development, you don't see them much in the technology business. In technology, companies that grow slowly tend not to grow as big.","google":"UA-44968033-9","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
